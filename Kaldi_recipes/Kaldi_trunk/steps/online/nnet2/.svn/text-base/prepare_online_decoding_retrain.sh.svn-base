# This is as prepare_online_decoding.sh, but it's for a special case, where we
# already have a directory that's been prepared in that way, but for another
# corpus, and we have used the script
# steps/online/nnet2/dump_nnet_activations.sh to dump activations of the last
# hidden layer of that network on our data, and then steps/nnet2/retrain_fast.sh
# to train a neural net on top of those activations.  The job of this script is
# to take the original neural net, and the net that was trained on top of
# its last hidden layer, combine them, and create an online-decoding directory
# in the same format as is created by prepare_online_decoding.sh.
# All the options for the feature extraction and the iVector extractor
# are taken from the original directory from the other corpus.
